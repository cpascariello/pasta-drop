## Backlog (Future Features)

### Flavor Chooser / Randomizer
Let users pick a "flavor" theme or randomize it. Different food puns for different pastes.

## Tone

- Playful, warm, Italian grandmother energy
- Food metaphors throughout
- Never takes itself too seriously
- Welcoming to crypto newcomers ("Buon appetito, anon")

## Visual Direction (suggestions)

- Warm colors: tomato red, pasta yellow, basil green
- Hand-drawn or slightly imperfect aesthetic
- Could use pasta/kitchen illustrations
- Dark mode default with warm accent colors
